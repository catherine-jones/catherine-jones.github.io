I assisted with onboarding team members remotely across APAC, EMEA and North America and developed an understanding of the complexities of international HR. I have created performance management frameworks as well as learning and development opportunities. I developed policies and procedures based on industry best practices and legislative requirements to drive engagement and employee retention.
