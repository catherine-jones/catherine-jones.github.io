            <p>I have spent the last four years working in product teams to deliver key business outcomes utilising my skills as a software developer to help startups and Government agencies create user-centric products. More recently I have been working as a Delivery Manager to facilitate agile ceremonies and drive deliverables at Expert360. These multidisciplinary roles have given me the skills I need to successfully take on the role and responsibilities of a product manager.</p>
            <p>I am an active member of the Sydney tech community and a passionate advocate for diversity. I was part of the first Australian Rails Girls Summer of Code team, which involved contributing to Spree Commerce. I was also a Co-Organiser of Women Who Code Sydney. Since then I have founded Elixir Girls a two-day program aimed at increasing the number of women learning functional languages. In my spare time, I like to gather data about diversity in the Australian technology community, play with my sausage dog and knit.</p>

                     <p>As a delivery manager, I work with multidisciplinary teams as a servant leader to improve and support agile practices at all levels of the organisation. I use my skills as a problem solver to assist, guide and facilitate where needed but I am not afraid of getting in and doing the actual work. I have a passion for building diverse and inclusive teams and empowering those teams to deliver user centred products. I helped the company achieve a successful 13Million series B raise in July 2017 by improving and supporting agile practices in our delivery teams. Since then we have continued to work on improving our Continuous delivery practices and addressing our technical debt and user experience. </p>

                       <p>As a Transformational Engineer at the DTA, I have helped prototype complex applications rapidly based on user needs. After validating and quickly iterating on our prototype, I have created usable, semantic and accessible front end interfaces while working in cross functional agile teams. I ran regular knowledge sharing workshops on basic coding techniques, security and commonly used products such as GitHub to improve collaboration between technical and non-technical team members. I assisted in implementing a design guide approach to Government services. I helped run the DTA's technology guild which brings our entire technology team together fortnightly to share knowledge and address the technology issues in government.</p>
