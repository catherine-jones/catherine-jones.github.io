            <p>I have spent the last four years working in product teams to deliver key business outcomes utilising my skills as a software developer to help startups and Government agencies create user-centric products. More recently I have been working as a Delivery Manager to facilitate agile ceremonies and drive deliverables at Expert360. These multidisciplinary roles have given me the skills I need to successfully take on the role and responsibilities of a product manager.</p>
            <p>I am an active member of the Sydney tech community and a passionate advocate for diversity. I was part of the first Australian Rails Girls Summer of Code team, which involved contributing to Spree Commerce. I was also a Co-Organiser of Women Who Code Sydney. Since then I have founded Elixir Girls a two-day program aimed at increasing the number of women learning functional languages. In my spare time, I like to gather data about diversity in the Australian technology community, play with my sausage dog and knit.</p>
