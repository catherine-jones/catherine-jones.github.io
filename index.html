            <h1 class="title_resalt">“I enjoy writing simple and elegant code that creates a beautiful user experiance”</h1>

            <p>As a developer I enjoy working in multidisciplinary teams to build accessible user interfaces. I write semantic and accessible HTML to meet WACG guidelines and clean, modular, reusable styles. I have experience with Bootstrap, Bourbon and custom layout systems as well as building style guides and UI Kits. To add interactivity to applications I primarily use a combination of Javascript and JQuery and am currently developing my skills with React JS.</p>
            <p>I am an active member of the Sydney tech community community and a passionate advocate for diversity in technology. I was part of the first Australian Rails Girls Summer of Code team, which involved contributing to Spree Commerce. I was also a Co-Organiser of Women Who Code Sydney. Since then I have volunteered at a number of different events including Rails Girls and Women Who Code to encourage and inform women of the options available in the technology sector. I also assisted in the organisation and running of Node Bots 2016 and have spoken at multiple technology meetups, conferences and on national radio. In my spare time I build applications focused on gathering data about the Australian technology community.</p>
